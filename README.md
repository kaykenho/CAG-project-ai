# Cache Augmented Generation Implementation with GPT-2

## Overview
This project implements Cache Augmented Generation (CAG) using the GPT-2 language model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. CAG enhances traditional language models by maintaining a context cache, allowing the model to access and utilize relevant historical information during text generation. This implementation demonstrates how to augment GPT-2's capabilities with a simple but effective caching mechanism.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Model Architecture**
   - Base Model: GPT-2 (using the standard variant)
   - Framework: Hugging Face Transformers
   - Primary Enhancement: Cache-augmented generation capability

2. **Cache System**
   - Implementation: Python's `collections.deque` with fixed maximum size
   - Cache Size: 5 entries (configurable)
   - Storage: Text-based entries
   - Retrieval: Last k (default: 3) relevant entries

3. **Key Functions**

#### Cache Management
- `add_to_cache(text, cache)`: Adds new entries to the cache
- `retrieve_from_cache(query, cache, k=3)`: Retrieves relevant cached content

#### Generation
- `generate_with_cache(query, cache, model, tokenizer, max_length=1024, max_new_tokens=50)`:
  - Combines cached context with current query
  - Handles tokenization and attention masking
  - Manages sequence length constraints
  - Implements safety checks for token validation

### Advanced Features

1. **Context Management**
   - Dynamic context construction from cache entries
   - Automatic truncation to handle model's maximum sequence length
   - Left-side padding for proper attention mechanics

2. **Generation Controls**
   - Temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity)
   - Top-p (nucleus sampling): 0.9
   - Top-k: 50
   - N-gram repetition prevention
   - Attention masking for proper context handling

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
```

### Model Configuration
- Padding: Left-side padding with EOS token
- Evaluation Mode: Enabled (training features disabled)
- Maximum Length: 1024 tokens
- New Tokens Limit: 50 tokens per generation

## Innovation and Impact

### Advantages of Cache Augmented Generation

1. **Enhanced Context Awareness**
   - Maintains historical context across generations
   - Improves coherence in long-form content
   - Reduces context fragmentation

2. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Fixed-size cache prevents unlimited memory growth
   - Efficient retrieval mechanism
   - Configurable cache size for different use cases

3. **Improved Generation Quality**
   - Contextually aware responses
   - Better continuation of previous discussions
   - Reduced repetition through n-gram controls

### Applications and Use Cases

1. **Conversational AI**
   - Chatbots with memory
   - Customer service applications
   - Virtual assistants

2. **Content Generation**
   - Long-form article writing
   - Documentation generation
   - Story continuation

3. **Knowledge Management**
   - Information synthesis
   - Context-aware summarization
   - Dynamic knowledge base interaction

## Future Improvements

1. **Cache Enhancement**
   - Implement semantic similarity for better retrieval
   - Add priority-based cache management
   - Introduce cache entry expiration

2. **Model Optimization**
   - Fine-tuning for specific use cases
   - Implement dynamic temperature adjustment
   - Add adaptive context length management

3. **Feature Additions**
   - Multi-modal cache support
   - Distributed cache architecture
   - Real-time cache updates

## Contributing to AI Innovation

This implementation represents a step forward in making language models more context-aware and efficient. By combining traditional transformer architecture with cache augmentation, we're addressing one of the key limitations of current language models: their inability to maintain context over extended interactions.

The project demonstrates how relatively simple architectural additions can significantly enhance the capabilities of existing language models. It serves as a foundation for further research and development in the field of cache-augmented language models.

## Getting Started

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install transformers torch numpy
```

2. Import the project:
```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
```

3. Initialize the model and cache:
```python
model_name = "gpt2"
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

4. Start generating with cache support using the provided functions.
